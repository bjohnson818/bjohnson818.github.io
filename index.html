        <p>All of our dogs are rescues and each one of them has it's own unique personality, making our time with them very chaotic.</p>

        <h3>Finnegan</h3>
        <p>Finnegan, our small spotted brown and white dog, is just over 14yrs old.  In his old age he enjoys long naps, food,
            and being grumpy with our other 2 dogs.  For a dog of his age he still has energy to play fetch and go for walks.
            We adopted him from <a href="https://reddogfarm.com">Red Dog Farm</a> when we lived in North Carolina.

        <h3>Georgie</h3>
        <p> Georgie was our second rescue and he will be 8 this Halloween. He is a brown dog with a white belly.  Georgie is
            a collector of toys. His favorite thing to do is to present us or anyyone else who enters our home (Only if they are invited) with a
            personally selected toy. He loves to give hugs by which he will lean into you as you give him scratches and rubs. We adopted 
            Georgie from <a href="https://pawsshelter.org">PAWS Shelter</a> in Kyle, Texas when he was just about to turn 2.

        <h3>Lizzie</h3>
        <p>Lastly, we have Lizzie. She is our most recent addition and came to us by way of <a href="https://www.codysfriendsrescue.org"> 
            Cody's Friends</a> in Dallas, Texas. She was discovered, as a puppy, underneath the porch of a house in Houston, Texas.  
            She has just turned 1yr old and is full of puppy energy. She has tan coloring with white spots. She likes to sneak up to you and lick 
            you really fast, with her extremly long tongue, almost like a lizard catching a fly. This is how she got the name Lizzie which is short for Lizard.  
            Her other favorite thing to do is steal Georgie's toys.</p>
